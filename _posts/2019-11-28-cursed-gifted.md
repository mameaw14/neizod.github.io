So you understand everything around you fast. See through many complicated scenarios. And can manage any situations at ease. Sounds good right?

Yes it's surely is! Putting you in a foreign country and you can survive. Given little opportunities and you thrive.

But then you realize that you're living on earth, with all the people from full range of the bell-curve,

And everything start to fall apart when you can't communicate with others anymore.

A gifted? Maybe. A cursed? Surely!

Would you trade it for a normal life? Did you even have any freedom to choose?

For me, I don't know... Maybe I'm not belongs here anymore?
